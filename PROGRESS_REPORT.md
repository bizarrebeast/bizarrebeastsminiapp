# BizarreBeasts Mini App - Progress Report
## Session Date: September 17, 2025

## üéØ Session Overview
This session focused on fixing critical issues with the contest system after initial deployment, ensuring mobile responsiveness, and updating all documentation. We successfully resolved all reported issues and the contest system is now fully operational.

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing CTA Button on Contest Page ‚úÖ
**Problem**: User created a contest with CTA URL (https://treasure-quest.remix.gg/) but the button wasn't appearing on the contest page.

**Root Cause**: The API create endpoint wasn't saving CTA fields to the database.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `/api/admin/contests/create/route.ts` to properly save all CTA fields
- Added proper field mapping in the contestData object
- Files modified: `app/api/admin/contests/create/route.ts`

### 2. Contest Page Too Wide on Mobile ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Contest page was displaying too wide on mobile devices, especially in Farcaster app.

**Root Cause**:
- Table element had `min-w-[400px]` forcing minimum width
- Tabs container had `overflow-x-auto` causing horizontal scroll

**Solution**:
- Removed `min-w-[400px]` from leaderboard table
- Changed tabs from `overflow-x-auto` to `flex-wrap` for proper wrapping
- Files modified: `app/contests/[id]/page.tsx`

### 3. Submit Entry Button Not Working ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Submit Entry button was just scrolling to top of page instead of opening submission form.

**Root Cause**: Navigation logic was using Next.js Link component incorrectly.

**Solution**:
- Replaced Link components with button elements and proper click handlers
- Added router.push for internal navigation
- Files modified: `components/contests/ContestActionButtons.tsx`

### 4. No Contest Edit Capability ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Admin panel had no way to edit existing contests after creation.

**Root Cause**: Edit functionality wasn't implemented in admin interface.

**Solution**:
- Created new `EditContestForm` component
- Added edit buttons to admin contest table
- Implemented update API endpoint
- Files created: `components/admin/EditContestForm.tsx`
- Files modified: `app/admin/contests/page.tsx`

### 5. Authentication Errors When Editing ‚úÖ
**Problem**: 401 Unauthorized and 500 errors when trying to save contest edits.

**Root Cause**:
- Missing admin wallet in request headers
- Update route not using proper authentication
- RLS policies blocking regular client updates

**Solution**:
- Added admin wallet to EditContestForm requests
- Fixed update route to use `validateAdminAccess`
- Changed to `supabaseAdmin` to bypass RLS
- Files modified:
  - `components/admin/EditContestForm.tsx`
  - `app/api/admin/contests/update/route.ts`

### 6. CTA Button Not Working on Mobile ‚úÖ
**Problem**: CTA button only working on desktop, not mobile PWA or Farcaster app.

**Root Cause**: Navigation logic was trapped inside tracking conditional - only executing if tracking was enabled.

**Solution**:
- Restructured click handler to always execute navigation
- Separated tracking logic from navigation logic
- Files modified: `components/contests/ContestActionButtons.tsx`

### 7. Contest Share Not Embedding on Farcaster ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Contest page links not showing preview when shared on Farcaster.

**Root Cause**: URL mismatch - share buttons using `bizarrebeastsminiapp.com` instead of actual domain `bizarrebeasts.io`.

**Solution**:
- Updated contextUrl to use correct production domain
- Changed from `https://bbapp.bizarrebeastsminiapp.com` to `https://bbapp.bizarrebeasts.io`
- Files modified: `app/contests/[id]/page.tsx`
