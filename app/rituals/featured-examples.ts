/**
 * HOW TO USE:
 *
 * 1. In app/rituals/page.tsx, import the example you want:
 *    import { sponsoredExample } from './featured-examples';
 *
 * 2. Replace the featuredRitual constant with your chosen example:
 *    const featuredRitual = sponsoredExample;
 *
 * 3. Or set to null to hide the featured section:
 *    const featuredRitual = null;
 *
 * VISUAL DIFFERENCES:
 *
 * - Regular (no sponsorType): Shows "FEATURED RITUAL" with star emojis
 * - Sponsored: Shows "SPONSORED RITUAL" with "AD" badge
 * - Collab: Shows "COLLABORATION" with "COLLAB" badge
 * - Partner: Shows "PARTNER RITUAL" with "PARTNER" badge
 *
 * All sponsored content will also show the sponsor name/logo below the header
