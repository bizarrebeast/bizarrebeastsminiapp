# 🎨 BizarreBeasts Homepage Redesign - Comprehensive Plan

## 🎯 Current Issues with Homepage
- **Static Features Grid**: Current "features" section is just navigation with no dynamic content
- **No User Engagement**: Missing personalization, activity feeds, or social proof
- **Lacks Community Feel**: No visibility into what's happening in the ecosystem
- **No Clear User Journey**: New users don't have a clear onboarding path
- **Missing Daily Hooks**: No incentive for daily visits (streaks, rewards, etc.)

## 🚀 Proposed Homepage Sections

### 1. **Hero Section (Keep & Enhance)**
✅ Current banner is good
- Add animated $BB token price ticker
- Include live "Users Online" counter
- Show real-time treasury value
- Add countdown timer for next distribution/event

### 2. **Quick Actions Hub** (Replace static CTAs)
Dynamic action cards based on user state:
- **New User**: "Claim Welcome Bonus" → "Join Empire" → "Play First Game"
- **Returning User**: "Continue Streak (Day X)" → "Claim Daily Reward" → "New Meme Contest"
- **Token Holder**: "Your Rank: #X" → "Boost Multiplier" → "Vote on Proposal"

### 3. **Live Activity Feed**
Real-time community activity stream:
```
🎮 @beastmode just scored 42,000 in Treasure Quest
💎 @gemhunter climbed to Rank #25 in Empire
🎨 @artlover created a new meme (show thumbnail)
🏆 @winner won 500 $BB in daily lottery
🔥 5 players are battling in Beast Arena right now
```

### 4. **Daily Ritual Dashboard**
Gamified daily engagement system:
- **Check-in Streak**: Visual calendar with rewards milestones
- **Daily Challenges**:
  - Play 3 games → Earn 10 $BB
  - Create 1 meme → Unlock special sticker
  - Visit Empire → Get 2x booster
- **Progress Bars**: Show completion status
- **Time-gated Rewards**: "Next reward in 3h 42m"

### 5. **Trending Now** (Dynamic Content Discovery)
Algorithm-based content highlighting:
- **Hot Memes**: Most liked/shared in last 24h (with voting)
- **Rising Players**: Biggest rank climbs today
- **Popular Games**: Current most-played with live player counts
- **Community Picks**: User-voted content of the week

### 6. **Your Empire Status** (Personalized Dashboard)
For connected wallets only:
```
