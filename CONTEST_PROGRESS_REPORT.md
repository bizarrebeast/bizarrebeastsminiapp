## ✅ Session 2 Accomplishments (January 17, 2025)

### Part A: Feature Implementation (Morning)

### 1. **Submission System Complete**
- ✅ Built full submission form (`/components/contests/SubmissionForm.tsx`)
  - Score input for game contests
  - Image/screenshot upload capability
  - Token balance verification before submission
  - Success confirmation that stays visible for sharing
  - Context-aware labels ("Screenshot" for games, "Image" for creative)
- ✅ Created submission API endpoint (`/app/api/contests/submit/route.ts`)
  - Validates token requirements
  - Handles multipart form data
  - Integrates with R2 for image storage
  - Prevents duplicate submissions based on contest rules

### 2. **Admin Panel Built**
- ✅ Complete admin interface (`/app/admin/contests/page.tsx`)
  - Separated username and wallet into different columns
  - Thumbnail preview with adjustable sizes (small/medium/large)
  - Approve/reject functionality with notes
  - Filter by contest and status
  - Removed 800px width constraint for more space
- ✅ Admin API endpoints (`/app/api/admin/submissions/review/route.ts`)
  - Secure admin authentication via wallet
  - Approve/reject with reviewer tracking
  - GET endpoint for fetching submissions
- ✅ Screenshot modal component for full-size viewing

### 3. **Cloudflare R2 Storage Integration**
- ✅ Installed AWS SDK v3 packages
- ✅ Created R2 storage library (`/lib/r2-storage.ts`)
  - S3-compatible client configuration
  - Image validation (5MB max, proper formats)
  - Automatic key generation with timestamps
  - Public URL generation
- ✅ Configured R2 bucket in Cloudflare dashboard:
  - Bucket: `bizarrebeasts-contests`

  - Public access configured
- ✅ Updated `.env.local` with R2 credentials

### 4. **Database Improvements**
- ✅ Fixed Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) issues
  - Created admin-specific Supabase client (`/lib/supabase-admin.ts`)
  - Uses service role key to bypass RLS for admin operations
  - Regular client still uses anon key for user operations
- ✅ Created SQL debug scripts:
  - Column verification scripts
  - Status enum checking
  - Manual update testing

### 5. **UI/UX Improvements**
- ✅ Submission confirmation stays visible for sharing (removed auto-dismiss)
- ✅ Added thumbnail size toggle in admin panel (not zoom, but size options)
- ✅ Context-aware labeling:
  - "Screenshot Proof" for game_score contests
  - "Image Submission" for creative contests
- ✅ Proper placeholder images with camera icons for missing images

### Part B: Security & Deployment (Afternoon)

### 6. **Security Hardening**
- ✅ Removed hardcoded admin wallet fallback
- ✅ Deleted all test endpoints (/api/test-r2, /api/upload-temp, /test-supabase)
- ✅ Implemented rate limiting:
  - Contest submissions: 5 per minute per IP
  - Admin actions: 30 per minute per IP
- ✅ Fixed all TypeScript build errors
- ✅ Removed unused API endpoints

### 7. **Vercel Deployment**
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Configured all environment variables:
  - Contest settings (admin wallet, feature flags)
  - R2 storage credentials (with sensitive marking)
  - Supabase keys (public and service role)
- ✅ Successfully built and deployed to production
